# Terraform: Up and Running - Learning Repository

## ðŸ“š About This Repository

This repository contains my follow-along projects and exercises from **"Terraform: Up and Running"** by Yevgeniy Brikman. It represents an intentional effort to master Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles and Terraform best practices through hands-on implementation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- **Infrastructure as Code fundamentals** - Treating infrastructure like software
- **Terraform core concepts** - Resources, providers, state management
- **Progressive complexity** - Building from simple to production-ready infrastructure
- **Best practices** - Security, modularity, and maintainability
- **Real-world scenarios** - Practical implementations that mirror production environments

***NOTE: Some of the examples in the book use resources that have been deprecated, but my examples provide current solutions to those nuances.***
